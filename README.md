  - [Conda (Starting and managing)](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html#getting-started-with-conda) 
   
    :one: `conda --version` (in a terminal command line) :arrow_right: Conda version number (if it is installed properly).
    
    :two: `conda update conda` and then `y` (if needed) :arrow_right: Update conda to the current version.

    - Anaconda Prompt: :one: Start menu :two: search for and open "Anaconda Prompt". 
    - Windows Command Prompt: :one: Start menu :two: search for and open "cmd". 
        - When I typed `conda --version` in the Command Prompt, I encountered `conda is not recognized as an internal or external command,
          operable program or batch file`. This issue was resolved by *Method 3* of this [page](https://appuals.com/fix-conda-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command-operable-program-or-batch-file/).
  - [Managing environments](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#managing-environments)

       :four: `conda install pkgname` :arrow_right: Install the package "pkgname" in the active environment.
         
       :five: `conda list -n envname` or `conda list`:arrow_right: A list of all packages installed in the active environment. 
     
       :six: `conda list -n envname pkgname`:arrow_right: To see if the package "pkgname" is installed in "envname".
     
       :seven: `conda install --revision=0` or `conda install --rev 0`:arrow_right: Restore active environment to the default version.
    
       :eight: `conda deactivate` :arrow_right: Deactivate environment.

       :nine: `conda remove --name envname --all`:arrow_right: Remove the environment "envname".
       
      - If you encontered the Error 403 while `conda update conda` or `conda create -n envname`:
      
			conda config --add channels conda-canary
			conda config --remove channels defaults
        
    	or refer to [Troubleshooting (403 Error)](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/troubleshooting/?highlight=403#error).      

     - [Conda cheat sheet](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/_downloads/843d9e0198f2a193a3484886fa28163c/conda-cheatsheet.pdf)
     
  - Python and Jupyter Lab
     
     - Python Installation (by a terminal command line): Type `conda install python=vnumber` to install version "vnumber" of Python in the active environment.

     - Jupyter Lab Installation (by a terminal command line): Type `conda install jupyterlab` to install Jupyter Lab in the active environment.
     
     - Use `jupyter lab` to start Jupyter Lab.

     - [Installing the IPython kernel](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html#kernels-for-different-environments)
	    - Terminal command: `python -m ipykernel install --user --name envname --display-name "Python (envname)"`
		
  - [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/introduction.html)
  
     - Installing packages from conda-forge:
		
	    - `conda config --add channels conda-forge` :arrow_right: Register the conda-forge channel as a package source for conda
			
	    - `conda config --set channel_priority strict` :arrow_right: Activate the strict channel priority.
  
* **Python:**
   - GitHub Repository: [Practical Python](https://github.com/dabeaz-course/practical-python)
   - [Python Cheat Sheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coodict/python3-in-one-pic/master/py3%20in%20one%20pic.png)
   - [Python Cheat Sheet-Complete](https://zerotomastery.io/cheatsheets/python-cheat-sheet?utm_source=github&utm_medium=ztm-python-cheat-sheet)
   

   - Installation of python libraries:
   	 - Installing libraries with the command `conda install "libname"`:
	 
	 	Some libraries could not be installed with the above command line. Then, you can either do `pip install 
		"libname"` or download the source and install that manually as follows.
	 
  	 - **Installing libraries manually:**
   
   		Download the source file of the library containing the file `setup.py` :arrow_right: Launch the anaconda prompt and 
		navigate to the folder that contains the extracted downloaded files , e.g., with the command `cd /d d:\anaconda3\tflearn-
		master`  :arrow_right: Run `python setup.py install`

* **Colab:**
   - [What is Colaboratory?](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#scrollTo=5fCEDCU_qrC0)

   - A good approach to import local datasets into the Colab:
   
   		:one: Compress the dataset, i.e., as a `zip` file :two: Upload the compressed file to your Google drive :three: Mount your Google drive into the colab :four: Unzip the compressed file in Colab.

   - A good approach to unzip dataset files from Google drive into the content folder in colab:
   
   		```
   		import os
   		if not os.path.exists("/content/dataset"):
   		  print("unzip files!")
   	      !unzip -q "/content/drive/My Drive/dataset.zip"
   		```

   - [To prevent Google Colab from disconnecting](https://kapeli.com/cheat_sheets/LaTeX_Math_Symbols.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/index): 
   
    	> Google Colab notebooks have an idle timeout of 90 minutes and absolute timeout of 12 hours. This means, if user does not interact with his Google Colab notebook for more than 90 minutes,
                   its instance is automatically terminated. Also, maximum lifetime of a Colab instance is 12 hours.
		
   		To prevent Google Colab from disconnecting, Open developer settings in your web browser with `Ctrl+Shift+I` :arrow_right: Click on console tab  :arrow_right:  Type the following code block in the console prompt:
  	 ```javascript 
   	    function ClickConnect(){
		console.log("Working"); 
		document.querySelector("colab-toolbar-button").click() 
		}setInterval(ClickConnect,60000)
  	 ```

       - I had an issue with Anaconda installation on windows 7, `Failed to create Anaconda menus`. With the help of an [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57635204/12777699) from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python"><img  src=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Stack_Overflow_logo.png width="90"/>
</a>, version 2019.03 of Anaconda (from [download archive](https://repo.continuum.io/archive/)) successfully installed.

     By typing `conda --version` in a terminal command line verify that 
     conda is installed properly on your system (Conda displays the number of the version that you have installed). 
     
     By typing `conda update conda` and then `y` (if needed) in a terminal command line, update conda to the current version.

     1. **Anaconda Prompt:** From the Start menu, search for and open "Anaconda Prompt". 
     2. **Windows Command Prompt:** From the Start menu, search for and open "cmd". 
        - When I typed `conda --version` in the Command Prompt, I encountered `conda is not recognized as an internal or external command,
          operable program or batch file`. This issue was resolved by Method 3 of this helpful [page](https://appuals.com/fix-conda-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command-operable-program-or-batch-file/).
